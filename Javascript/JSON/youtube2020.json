does your body turn food into the poo Human digestion system in human beings|English subtitle","description":"How your body turns food into the poo Human digestion system \n#stomach #digestivesystem #colon \nHow does your body turn food into poop?\nMechanical digestion begins in the mouth as the food is chewed. . Chemical digestion begins in the mouth when food mixes with saliva. Saliva contains an enzyme (amylase) \nthat begins the breakdown of carbohydrates.\nThe epiglottis is a flexible flap at the end of the larynx in the throat. It acts as a switch between the larynx and the esophagus to permit air to enter the airway to the lungs and\nfood to pass into the esophagus. it is a muscular tube connecting the throat with the stomach. The esophagus is about 8 inches long.\nThe esophagus muscle acts with peristaltic action to move swallowed food down to the stomach. The action of peristalsis looks like an ocean wave moving through the muscle\nThe food then enters the stomach, which is a rounded, hollow j shape organ Located between the esophagus and the duodenum. the stomach has three mechanical tasks to \ndo. First, the stomach must store the swallowed food and liquid. This requires the \nmuscle of the upper part of the stomach to relax and accept large volumes of swallowed \nmaterial., The inner layer of the stomach is full of wrinkles known as rugae. Rugae both \nallow the stomach to stretch in order to accommodate large meals and help to grip and \nmove food during digestion.\nThe second job is to mix up the food, liquid, with digestive juice produced by the \nstomach. The lower part of the stomach mixes these materials as a blender by its \nmuscle action. and breaks down the food into tiny particles in 3 millimeters \nfinally, the stomach empties this acidy mash slowly into the small intestine.\nThe small intestine or small bowel is an organ in the gastrointestinal tract where most of \nthe end absorption of nutrients and minerals from food takes place. It lies between the \nstomach and large intestine and receives bile and pancreatic juice through the \npancreatic duct to aid in digestion.\nThe Duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, receives partially digested \nfood from the stomach and begins the absorption of nutrients. The duodenum is \nthe shortest segment of the intestine and is about 23 to 28 cm (9 to 11 inches) \nlong. It is roughly horseshoe-shaped\n The pancreatic juices and bile that are released into the duodenum, help the body to \ndigest fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. \nThe food is in instetin now and has a very long way to go!\nAs a person grows the small intestine increases 20 times in length from about 200 cm in a\nnewborn to almost 6 m in an adult.\nThe inner walls of the small intestine show mucosal folds. These are called the plicae \ncirculares. The plicae are more numerous in the early and reduce in numbers in the later \npart and are completely absent.\nDigestion is important because your body needs nutrients from food and drink to \nwork properly and stay \nhealthy. Proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and water are \nnutrients. Your digestive system breaks nutrients into parts small enough for \nyour body to absorb and use for energy, growth, and cell repair.\n•Proteins break into amino acids\n•Fats break into fatty acids and glycerol\n•Carbohydrates break into simple sugars\nIn the small bowel, the food particles get even smaller. Here is where all the \nimportant vitamins and nutrients in food move through the blood vessels that are \nin the lining of the small bowel. The blood takes the nutrients to other organs in \nthe body. The nutrients are used to help repair cells and tissue.\nWhat is left over, which is mostly liquid, then moves into the colon. The water \nis absorbed in the colon. Bacteria in the colon break down the remaining \nmaterial. Then the colon moves the leftover material into the rectum. \n\nthe rectum is like a storage-holder for this waste. Muscles in the rectum move the\nwaste, called stool, out of the body through the anus.\n\n0:01  How does your body turn food into the poo\n0:08  food in the mouth \n0:34  Esophagus\n0:52

This ruler was Osman I, and with the help of his successors, they built the mightiest Middle Eastern Empire of their time. The term Ottoman originates from “Uthman” which is Arabic for Osman, named after the ruler who had the dream of the Ottoman Empire. We are going to review the historic events that marked the chronology of this mighty empire.\n\nSome Footage from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnNvsm8Bzk8\nSubscribe to Nedim Can Incebay: https://www.youtube.com/c/NedimCanIncebay\n\nMusic:\n\nDramatic Trailer  by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5633-dramatic-trailer-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nOrchestral Trailer  by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5374-orchestral-trailer-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nThe Enemy by Alexander Nakarada\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/4962-the-enemy\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nCursed Intro  by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5624-cursed-intro-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nKingdom Of Heaven  by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5365-kingdom-of-heaven-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nThe Gigantic Epic Day After Tomorrow by Sascha Ende\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/413-the-gigantic-epic-day-after-tomorrow\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUWzm7yb5oA/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUWzm7yb5oA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUWzm7yb5oA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUWzm7yb5oA/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZUWzm7yb5oA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Simply Explained","tags":["ottoman empire","ottomans","ottoman empire history","ottoman empire explained","ottoman","history of ottoman empire","history ottoman empire","ottomans explained"],"categoryId":"27","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en","videoDuration":"PT7M31S","videoDimension":"2d","videoDefinition":"hd","videoCaption":"true","videoLicensedContent":true,"videoProjection":"rectangular","viewCount":"6536720","likeCount":"76720","favouriteCount":"0","commentCount":"10239"},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"yOzy9eowbpC-fFWzKked24lNGbM","id":"Gs--6c7Hn_A","publishedAt":"2020-10-15T00:00:03Z","channelId":"UC_IRYSp4auq7hKLvziWVH6w","title":"Disney and Pixar’s Soul | Official Trailer 2 | Disney+","description":"Life is full of possibilities, you just have to know where to look. Watch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s Soul, streaming this Christmas only on Disney+. \n\nAbout Soul: \nWhat is it that makes you...YOU? This Christmas only on Disney+, Pixar Animation Studios’ all-new feature film “Soul” introduces Joe Gardner (voice of Jamie Foxx) – a middle-school band teacher who gets the chance of a lifetime to play at the best jazz club in town. But one small misstep takes him from the streets of New York City to The Great Before – a fantastical place where new souls get their personalities, quirks and interests before they go to Earth. Determined to return to his life, Joe teams up with a precocious soul, 22 (voice of Tina Fey), who has never understood the appeal of the human experience. As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what’s great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions. Directed by Academy Award® winner Pete Docter (“Inside Out,” “Up”), co-directed by Kemp Powers (“One Night in Miami”) and produced by Academy Award nominee Dana Murray, p.g.a. (Pixar short “Lou”), Disney and Pixar’s “Soul” is streaming only on Disney+ beginning December 25. \n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/pixarsoul/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/pixarsoul\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/pixarsoul/\nHashtag: #PixarSoul","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gs--6c7Hn_A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gs--6c7Hn_A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gs--6c7Hn_A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gs--6c7Hn_A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gs--6c7Hn_A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Pixar","tags":["Pixar","Disney","Disney Pixar","Pixar Movie","Animation","Soul","Trailer","Movie Trailer","New Movie Trailer","New Trailer","Disney Trailer","New Disney Trailer","Pixar trailer","New Pixar Movie","New Pixar Movie Trailer","Pixar Movie Trailer","Pixar Soul","Pixar's Soul","Disney Soul","Disney's Soul","Disney+","Disney Plus","Disney Plus Pixar Movie","Disney+ Pixar Movie","Disney+ Trailer","Disney+ New Trailer","Disney+ New Movie","Christmas Movie","Holiday Movie","Jamie Foxx","Questlove","Daveed Diggs"],"categoryId":"1","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"none","videoDuration":"PT2M24S","videoDimension":"2d","videoDefinition":"hd","videoCaption":"true","videoLicensedContent":true,"videoProjection":"rectangular","viewCount":"6194807","likeCount":"75406","favouriteCount":"0","commentCount":"5694"},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"H6Ai6quLLETD11Ap2Jd46UvrCIc","id":"4Kc3x1wbqNA","publishedAt":"2020-06-11T16:34:11Z","channelId":"UCTsM1dSAiXqiV5oZjuNw_Bg","title":"SHREDDED ABS and LOSE BELLY FAT in 7 Days | 10 min Home Workout","description":"Get shredded abs and lose belly fat in 7 days with this 10 minute home workout.

Add 400 gr\ncanned chickpeas in a large bowl and rub to take the skin of.\n- Fill the bowl with water and skins will start to float. When you drain, skins will group\non water and it will be much easier to collect.\n- Add peeled chickpeas, 2 cloves of garlic, half of a teaspoon salt, 6 tablespoons of\ntahini and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to food processor.\n- Squeeze a lemon juice and run for 7-8 minutes on low-medium speed.\n- While the food processor is working the hummus will get warm. To avoid that add 6\ncubes of ice gradually. ıce will help to make a smooth hummus as well.\n- After a couple of minutes hummus will be ok but not smooth enough. Don’t give\nup and continue until the hummus is creamy. You can run on high speed at this stage.\n- Taste and adjust the lemon, tahini and salt to your taste. Garlic and olive oil always\nneed time to settle. If you have 2-3 hours before eating the taste will be better.\n- When the hummus is ready put on serving table and make a little crater with the\nback of a spoon.\n- Sprinkle ground sumac, cumin and parsley leaves. Last but not least pour 2-3\ntablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.\n- Enjoy your creamy, tasty, simple hummus with your lavash or chips as your spoon!\n\n#Hummus #HummusRecipe","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88ljbueBLBw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88ljbueBLBw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88ljbueBLBw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88ljbueBLBw/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/88ljbueBLBw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Refika's Kitchen","tags":["refika","refika's kitchen","hummus","hummus recipe","how to make hummus","how to make hummus at home","homemade hummus","homemade hummus recipe","Houmous","houmous recipe","making hummus","turkish cuisine","vegan recipes","easy hummus recipe","best hummus recipe","chickpea recipes","humus","humus recipe","refika birgul","refikas kitchen","homemade humus recipe","DIY hummus recipe","turkish appetizer recipes","middle eastern foods","middle eastern recipes","lebanese food recipes"],"categoryId":"26","liveBroadcastContent":"none","defaultLanguage":"en-GB","videoDuration":"PT8M39S","videoDimension":"2d","videoDefinition":"hd","videoCaption":"true","videoLicensedContent":true,"videoProjection":"rectangular","viewCount":"3949394","likeCount":"154607","favouriteCount":"0","commentCount":"5903"},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"Ng54Qf2QhzWhbOpBQJo7yQg6FLQ","id":"-9octw2EHz0","publishedAt":"2020-11-30T19:14:46Z","channelId":"UCjbD71AM14srb3PdEsHiWQQ","title":"Nintendo Switch Easter Eggs #shorts","description":"You may love the Nintendo Switch, but did you know about all of these hidden features?\n\nIf you know of any more, share in the comments!\n\n#shorts\n\nThanks for watching! \nAny other ideas for shorts?

You can skip that step if you using metal skewers.\n• Mix the red hot chili pepper, red pepper, green peppers and the garlic and chop them together again.\n• Season with salt and red pepper flakes -if using sweet peppers-.\n• Add the meat and chop them together to mix for 2 minutes.\n• Divide the mixture into 4 equal parts.\n• Mold each part onto separate skewers. Slowly push the meat mixture from top to the bottom with your fingers. Leave 3 cm gaps from the top and the bottom of the skewer. If the meat mixture seperate from the skewer, refrigerate it for  around 15 minutes. Wetting your hands with cold water will help preventing stickiness.\n• Refrigerate for 15 minutes.\n• These are traditionally cooked on the barbecue, but I have a technique for you to create the same great taste at home using a cast iron pan. Heat your cast iron pan on high heat.\n• When the pan is hot, place your skewers on the sides of the pan without touching any part touching the bottom. This way, the heat from the pan will cook them. \n• Flip the skewers regularly and cook for 5-6 minutes.\n• For the onion with sumac, sprinkle a pinch of salt on the onions and rub it to soften. \n• Add in the olive oil, ground sumac, parsley, the rest of the salt, then mix again.\n• Put the lavaş on the kebap and press to let the bread soak all the flavours from the kebap.\n• It is time to eat! Wrap them all together in the lavash and take the perfect bite.
